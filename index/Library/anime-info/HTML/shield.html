    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>
        "The Rising of the Shield Hero" follows the story of Naofumi Iwatani, <br>
        a young man who is summoned to a parallel world as one of the Four Cardinal Heroes. <br>
        Unlike his companions who wield offensive weapons, Naofumi is granted the Shield, often considered the weakest <br>
        and least desirable of the four. Betrayed and falsely accused of a crime he didn't commit, <br>
        Naofumi is left with no one to trust except for a mysterious girl named Raphtalia. <br>
        Together, they embark on a journey to clear Naofumi's name, protect the world from waves of catastrophe, <br>
        and uncover the truth behind their summoning.
    </p>
